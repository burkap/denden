# denden game engine
Denden is a game development framework written for fun. It's basically my playground project for testing things like modern c++ features and software design patterns. However, this does not mean that this framework is incapable of producing a real game (albeit an ugly one). To prove this, I plan to add some examples of playable games written using this framework in the future.
